cdk
===

A Ruby version of Thomas Dickey version of the curses development kit providing
many easy-to-use [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface)
widgets.

Originally based on the [tawny-cdk](https://github.com/masterzora/tawny-cdk)
library, this was forked and 'gemified' due to original project inactivity.

Simply install with

```
  $ gem install cdk
```

Currently requires ncursesw (previously ncurses-ruby, check your dependencies!)

Implemented widgets:
 * Alphalist
 * Button
 * Buttonbox
 * Calendar
 * Dialog
 * Entry
 * File Selector
 * Graph
 * Histogram
 * Item List
 * Label
 * Matrix
 * Marquee
 * Menu
 * Multiple Line Entry
 * Radio List
 * Scale
 * Scrolling List
 * Scrolling Window
 * Selection List
 * Slider
 * Template
 * Viewer
 * More Coming Soon!
